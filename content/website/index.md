Look what I made!
Is it perfect? Nope. Am I *so* proud of it? You betcha.

I started my postdoc with almost no experience with coding. But fortuitously, at the same time my project turned towards RNAseq, I found out that Dr. Dan Beiting at the University of Pennslyvania vet school runs a fantastic course called [DIY transcriptomics](https://diytranscriptomics.com/) in which he teaches complete coding novices how to analyze transcriptomics data from start to finish using R. You can take the class in person if you're at Penn, but he has also put all of his course info on his website so you can do it independently and remotely. It's fantastic.

Anyway, not only did I learn how to analyze my own data, but I also learned that you can use R markdown to make your own website. For free. I've combined what I learned in that class with other handy tutorials online to scrape together this site. It's a work in progress, but below are some things that I found helpful:

\*I used the [Ananke theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/gohugo-theme-ananke/) from [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a starting template for my site.

\*My code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/LrnWalker), but please don't judge me for any dumb mistakes. Or better yet, tell me how to fix them?

\*The [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) gives a lot of useful info on how to make and launch a website

\*You can just search Google for cheatsheets for R markdown syntax

\*I bought my domain name on [Name Cheap](https://www.namecheap.com/), it was ~$6 for a year

Are there easier ways to do this? Yeah, you can use any of the drag and drop website builders to make a site that probably looks and works better. But then you have to pay money or have ads. For me, it was fun and frustrating to figure this out and I like a good challenge.

So here it is, a $6 website.

This is also how I approach my science- Nothing is impossible. Problems require creativity, hardwork, and perseverance. But they can be solved. You just have try and be determined to succeed.
