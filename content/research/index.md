Throughout my research career, I have focused on the unique biology that allows axons, which wire the nervous system, to develop, form synapses, degenerate, regenerate. In my postdoctoral work, funded by a NRSA and a K01 career development award, I have established the larval zebrafish pectoral fin as a powerful vertebrate model to study axon guidance and synapse formation in development and regeneration. Using this model, I discovered a [noncanonical role](10.1242/dev.199790) for a classic neuromuscular synapse development pathway that regulates the size and distribution of synapses specifically in the appendicular muscle of the pectoral fin. Moreover, I established that after injury, fin motor axons regenerate back to their original targets and re-form functional synapses. In my future lab, I will leverage the strengths of the larval zebrafish, including long-term timelapse imaging, transgenic tools to observe, ablate, or sequence specific cell types, and the generation of mutants using CRISPR, to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate target-selective axon guidance and synapse formation in a vertebrate during both development and regeneration.
