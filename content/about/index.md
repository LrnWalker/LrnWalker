After growing up on a cattle farm in rural Indiana, Lauren earned BS degrees in Biology and Neuroscience from Indiana University, Bloomington. She received her PhD in neurobiology from Washington University in St. Louis, where she studied the molecular mechanisms of axon degeneration with [Aaron DiAntonio](https://sites.wustl.edu/diantonio/). 

As a postdoctoral fellow with [Michael Granato](https://www.med.upenn.edu/granato/) at the University of Pennsylvania, Lauren is interested in how axons, which wire the nervous system, find their correct targets. She has developed the larval zebrafish pectoral fin as a new vertebrate model to uncover the cellular and molecular mechanisms of target-selective axon regeneration. 

* K01 career development award
* NRSA postdoctoral fellowship
* Intersections Fellows Associate (2021)
* Best Postdoctoral Presentation award at the [Hilde Mangold Symposium](https://www.sdbonline.org/hilde_mangold_symposium) at the Society for Developmental Biology annual meeting (2020)


In her freetime, you can find Lauren outdoors hiking or camping.
