      <description>After growing up on a cattle farm in rural Indiana, Lauren earned BS degrees in Biology and Neuroscience from Indiana University, Bloomington. She received her PhD in neurobiology from Washington University in St. Louis, where she studied the molecular mechanisms of axon degeneration with Aaron DiAntonio.
As a postdoctoral fellow with Michael Granato at the University of Pennsylvania, Lauren is interested in how axons, which wire the nervous system, find their correct targets.</description>

      <description>Regeneration of the motor neuron innervation of a larval zebrafish pectoral fin over 2 days
  Throughout my research career, I have focused on the unique biology that allows axons, which wire the nervous system, to develop, form synapses, degenerate, regenerate. In my postdoctoral work, funded by a NRSA and a K01 career development award, I have established the larval zebrafish pectoral fin as a powerful vertebrate model to study axon guidance and synapse formation in development and regeneration.</description>

      <description>Look what I made! Is it perfect? Nope. Am I so proud of it? You betcha.
I started my postdoc with almost no experience with coding. But fortuitously, at the same time my project turned towards RNAseq, I found out that Dr. Dan Beiting at the University of Pennslyvania vet school runs a fantastic course called DIY transcriptomics in which he teaches complete coding novices how to analyze transcriptomics data from start to finish using R.</description>
